# Getting Started with SportSee App

This project needs backend and frontend apps.

## Backend
clone this repo https://github.com/OpenClassrooms-Student-Center/P9-front-end-dashboard
### `npm install` 
to install the backend
### `npm start`
to run the backend. Message 'magic happens on port 3000' indicates the backend has successfully started on port 3000

## Frontend
clone this repo https://github.com/MenAllen/PhilippeJoubard_P12_032022.git
### `npm install`
to install the frontend
### `npm start`
to run the frontend. A message will warn you that port 3000 is already in use and asks if you want to use another one. Then type the key 'y' to accept. A browser window then opens so that you can access the app

## JS Doc
JSDoc is available in jsdoc directory. Launch index.html (located in jsdoc directory) to vizualize the code documentation.

## MOCK / API Configuration switch
A boolean named 'MOCKED_DATA' is defined in /src/utils/api.jsx. If set to true, mocked data is chosen, if set to false, API data is chosen. Note the current value is displayed in Home page, bottom right of screen.
